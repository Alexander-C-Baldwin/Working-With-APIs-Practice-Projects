# Working-With-APIs-Practice-Projects

For this practice project I wrote a self contained program that generates data visualization based on data it receives.
I used an API to automatcially request specific information from a website and use that information to make a visualization.

## Github API project
For this project I used Github API to automatically download information about the most starred Python projects on Github and then created a visualization of these projects.

## Hacker News API practice
For this I practiced more using Hacker News API to access and analyze data of the most popular articles on that site.
